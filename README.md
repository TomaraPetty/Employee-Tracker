## Description 
*Overview of this project:* <br> 
As a business owner I want to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company so that I can organize and plan my business. <br>
* The CMS includes one SQL database with three tables. <br>
`Employee | Role | Department` <br>
* Inquirer is used to prompt the user for information about the employees, roles and departments.
* The user can:
    1. Add employees
    2. Add Departments
    3. Add Roles
    4. View Employees
    5. View Roles
    6. View Departments
    7. Update employee roles
* If the user is trying to "view" information it will be pulled up in a table. 
* If the user wants to update or add information Inquirer will ask the proper questions and once answered, the information will be updated into the database.
